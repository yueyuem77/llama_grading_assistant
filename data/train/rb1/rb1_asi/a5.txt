Topic: How does the author develop the character of Ponyboy in The 
Outsiders?

In The Outsiders, Ponyboy starts out as a kid who sees the world in black 
and white—Greasers versus Socs, good versus bad. But by the end of the 
novel, he learns that people are more complicated than that. One important 
moment is when Ponyboy reads the poem "Nothing Gold Can Stay" by Robert 
Frost. He realizes that things change and that people aren’t all good or 
bad. This is also shown when he talks to Randy, one of the Socs, and 
realizes that they have more in common than he thought. Ponyboy grows up a 
lot in the book, and by the end, he understands that life is more 
complicated than he used to think.
