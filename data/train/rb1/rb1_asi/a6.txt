Topic: What is the role of fear in Lord of the Flies?

In Lord of the Flies, fear is a big part of the story. The boys on the 
island are afraid of the beast, but the beast isn’t real. It represents 
the fear they have inside themselves. As their fear grows, they start 
acting more violently. This is shown when they kill Simon because they 
think he’s the beast. Jack uses fear to control the other boys, making 
them follow him instead of Ralph. The author uses fear to show how people 
can lose control and act in ways they wouldn’t if they weren’t afraid.
