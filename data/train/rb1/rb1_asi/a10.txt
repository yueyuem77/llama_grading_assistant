Topic: What is the role of power in Macbeth?

Power is a major theme in Macbeth. Macbeth wants power so badly that he is 
willing to kill King Duncan to get it. After he becomes king, he does more 
terrible things to keep his power. But in the end, power makes him 
paranoid and unhappy. Lady Macbeth also wants power, but she can’t handle 
the guilt. The play shows that power can corrupt people and make them do 
things they wouldn’t normally do.
