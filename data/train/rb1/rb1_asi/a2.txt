Topic: What is the central theme of The Giver by Lois Lowry?

In The Giver, the central theme is the importance of individuality and 
freedom of choice. Jonas lives in a society where everything is 
controlled, and people don't have the freedom to make decisions for 
themselves. The novel shows how dangerous it is to live in a world without 
freedom, as people lose what makes them human. The turning point for Jonas 
is when he realizes that emotions, memories, and choices are what give 
life meaning. He says, "If you can't feel, what's the point of being 
alive?" By the end of the book, Jonas decides to leave the community so 
that people can regain their individuality. The theme is clear: freedom 
and emotions are necessary for a meaningful life.
