Topic: How does the author use symbolism in The Scarlet Letter?

In The Scarlet Letter, the author uses symbolism to show Hesterâ€™s 
struggle. The letter "A" she wears is a symbol of her sin, but it also 
becomes a symbol of strength. Hester stands up to the people who judge 
her, and the letter starts to mean something different. It shows how she 
takes control of her own identity. The author also uses light and dark as 
symbols. The forest is a place where Hester can be free, while the town is 
a place where she is judged.
