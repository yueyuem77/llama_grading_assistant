Topic: Analyze the character of Rainsford in The Most Dangerous Game.

Rainsford is a hunter who finds himself being hunted in The Most Dangerous 
Game. At the start of the story, he is confident and doesn't feel bad 
about hunting animals. He says, "The world is made up of two classes—the 
hunters and the huntees." But when he becomes the prey, his attitude 
changes. He learns what it feels like to be hunted and starts to 
understand that animals also feel fear. This makes him more empathetic. 
However, at the end of the story, Rainsford kills General Zaroff and seems 
to go back to being the same person. The story shows how extreme 
situations can change people, but it’s not clear if Rainsford really 
learns anything or just survives.
