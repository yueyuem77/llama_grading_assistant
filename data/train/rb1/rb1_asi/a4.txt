Topic: What is the theme of Romeo and Juliet?

In Romeo and Juliet, the theme is love. Romeo and Juliet are in love, but 
their families don't like each other. This is a big problem because their 
love is forbidden. Even though they try to be together, their families 
cause problems and they both die at the end. The theme is that love is 
very strong, but it can also be dangerous if people don’t agree with it. 
This is shown when Romeo says, "My only love sprung from my only hate!" 
They are sad because they can’t be together, but they try anyway.
