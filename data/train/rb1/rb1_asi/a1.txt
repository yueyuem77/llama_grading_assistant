Topic: How does the author use the character of Atticus Finch to develop 
the theme of justice in To Kill a Mockingbird?

Atticus Finch is a central figure in To Kill a Mockingbird, and through 
him, the author explores the theme of justice. In the novel, Atticus says, 
"You never really understand a person until you consider things from his 
point of view." This quote shows how justice isn't just about laws but 
about understanding and empathy. Throughout the trial of Tom Robinson, 
Atticus stands for fairness and equality, even when the majority of 
Maycomb does not. The author uses his character to show that justice is 
not always achieved in courtrooms but also in how we treat one another in 
our everyday lives. This is evident when Atticus says, "The one thing that 
doesn't abide by majority rule is a person's conscience." The way Atticus 
defends Tom, despite the odds, represents true justice. The theme of 
justice is developed through Atticus' actions, his words, and his ultimate 
failure to win the case, which shows the flaws in societyâ€™s justice 
system.
